*********************
Sphinx Homebrew Theme
*********************

A `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ theme that makes your doc
look like a fantasy roleplaying game source-book.

Installation
============

This package is not yet listed on pypi, but it will be once it's stable

Usage
=====

Stick this in your ``conf.py``:

.. code:: python

   html_theme = 'sphinx_homebrew_theme'

Development
===========

The main code in here is in ``theme/``, and there's a test document in
``test-doc`` that symlinks that theme in.

For notes about how to build/deploy each of those, see their respective
READMEs.
